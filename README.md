What & Why Typescript?
* Builds up on Javascript, 
* Browsers and Node.js cant execute Typescript
* Prog language & Tool, which compiles(TRANSPILE) Typescript code into Javascript (Like Babel?)
* It adds types (!!!) , helps identify errors earlier instead of finding it runtime on browser
* It can ONLY help during compilation
* JS uses "dynamic types" (resolved at runtime), TS uses "static types", set during development

Packages used
* https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server

Types:
* number: No differentiation between integers or floats
* string: All text values
* boolean: true|false , no truthy or falsy

Learnings:
tsc transpiles, and even if there is an error generates the js code.
